# zdeyns-guild-joinerator 1.2.0
Allows easy auto-join of Hardcore guilds using 'join x', 'join y', and 'join z' buttons (configurable!)

Supports setting guilds as 'restricted', meaning that only level 15+ characters will be whispered for an invite.

Easily integrates with players who aren't using it! 
 - Others invite you to the guild after receiving a plain whisper from you, and 
 - You invite others via a pop-up in response to being whispered `"ginv"`

Any problems, PLEASE:
 - log a report at https://github.com/church-of-hardcore/zdeyns-guild-joinerator
 - contact me (Zdeyn) via discord (zdeyn#7523), or
 - email me at `i.am.zdeyn@gmail.com`

Thanks in advance for your early feedback!
